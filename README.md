# BloodDonationProject
This is an app and web-based project for blood donation apps.
An essential element of human life is blood which has no substitute. The collection of blood from voluntary, non-remunerated blood donors is an important measure for ensuring the availability and safety of blood transfusion.  The milestone of an adequate and safe supply of blood and blood products is voluntary blood donors. Blood collection and blood donor is needed all over the world.

Technology means science and theories implementation to help the human beings. IT industries have become expensive due to rapid increases in the cost of the labour. We develop an online base voluntary blood donation system to help those people who are not able to buy blood.
This system reveals not only the benefits of the people that are directly making life easier for patients. That is why a voluntary Blood Donation Management system is needed to help people who need help.
To make easier the searching and manage essential groups of   blood at the crisis moment we feel the necessity of developing a mobile App.   

The project “Voluntary Blood Donation” is a mobile app that can be accessed easily through an Android mobile. It will be developed to meet the challenging requirement of modern-day blood to efficiently collect blood during an emergency.
It is based on the recognition that voluntary non-remunerated blood donors are the foundation of a safe, sustainable blood supply. No country can provide sufficient blood for all patients who require transfusion without a system based on voluntary unpaid blood donation, particularly regular voluntary donation. The voluntary blood donation  system reveals not only the benefits of the people that are directly making life easier for patients [1]. That is why a voluntary Blood Donation Management system is needed to help people who need help.
	
 
Blood donor details and patient information are entered and maintained in this project through a database.
In this world, as far as the present scenario is concerned, blood is as important as water. Several people die of loss of blood from their body and consequent weakness. Donating blood is the need of the hour and  the people of the world have risen to this challenge with zest. It has almost become a new trend nowadays to become a blood donor. But it is still quite a tricky job to search for proper and genuine blood donors. Therefore we choose to develop. 

•	This is an online website.
•	When a person wants to donate blood, he has to register with the system by filling up a registration form through the system.
•	After submitting the registration form, he can create a username and password.
•	Donor can also change his information using his username and password.
•	The people in need of blood can search for donors by giving their blood group and city name.
